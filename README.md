# **Smart Urban Lighting Infrastructure Management System**  
**High Achievers Team - Niral Thiruvizha**  

## **Problem Statement:**  
How might we develop an automated system for real-time street light fault detection, precise location tracking, and efficient maintenance in cities to enhance urban lighting infrastructure?  

## **Innovation Concepts:**  
Developing an **automated system** that integrates real-time fault detection, precise location tracking, and proactive maintenance to ensure **efficient urban street lighting management**.  

## **Expected Output:**  
- **Automated controller** for street light management.  
- **Real-time alert system** for police and TNEB (Tamil Nadu Electricity Board).  
- **Enhanced safety and security** through automated monitoring.

## **Abstraction:**  

### **1. Sensor-based Street Light Monitoring System**  
Each street light will be equipped with **smart sensors** to continuously monitor and analyze various parameters:  
- **Light Intensity** â€“ Detecting brightness levels.  
- **Power Consumption** â€“ Monitoring energy usage.  
- **Voltage Fluctuations** â€“ Identifying electrical issues.  
- **Motion Detection** â€“ Enhancing security by tracking movement.  

### **2. Data Collection & Processing**  
- A **centralized system** will collect and process sensor data.  
- **IoT-based wireless communication** to transmit real-time data.  
- **Automated analysis** to detect street light faults instantly.  

### **3. Location-based Fault Detection**  
- **GPS tracking** for pinpointing faulty street lights.  
- **Location-based alerts** for efficient maintenance team deployment.  

### **4. Automated Alert System**  
- **Real-time notifications** to stakeholders (Police, TNEB, local authorities).  
- **Alerts via SMS, email, and emergency sound systems** (e.g., virus alert sound).  
- **Mobile application** for street members to receive alerts and submit complaints.  
- **Emergency calling system** for residents in affected areas.  

### **5. Smart Surveillance Integration**  
- **High-resolution cameras** installed on street lights for monitoring.  
- **Visual data collection** for detecting faults (burnt-out bulbs, physical damage, tampering).  
- **Infrared sensors** for detecting overheating or electrical faults.  
- **Acoustic sensors** for detecting unusual sounds (mechanical faults or impacts).  
- **Vibration sensors** for structural integrity monitoring.  

### **6. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Cameras**  
- ANPR cameras to automatically capture and interpret **license plate information**.  
- **Crime prevention & traffic monitoring** without human intervention.
